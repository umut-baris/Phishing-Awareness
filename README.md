🎯 Phishing Awareness Web Application
This project is a phishing awareness web application developed as a part of my graduation project at Sabancı University. It aims to educate users about phishing attacks through interactive learning.

🔍 Features
Educational Videos: Short and informative videos to explain common phishing techniques.

Interactive Game: Users are presented with sample websites and emails, and must decide whether each is legitimate or a phishing attempt.

Instant Feedback: Wrong answers come with explanations to improve understanding.

⚙️ Tech Stack
Python / Django

HTML, CSS

SQLite (for demonstration)

💡 Purpose
The main goal is to raise awareness about phishing in a simple and engaging way. The application is designed to be functional rather than visually polished, especially in this initial version.
